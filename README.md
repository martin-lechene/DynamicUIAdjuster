### 1. **Select an Element to Modify:**

- Click on any element on the page you want to modify (e.g., a sidebar, search bar, or comment section).
- The selected element will **be highlighted with a red border** to indicate it‚Äôs ready for modification.

### 4. **Save Your Settings:**

- Once you're happy with the change, confirm your selection.
- Your settings are automatically saved in a `settings.json` file for future use.
- **Export** your settings anytime you want to move them to another browser or device.

## üåê **Example Use Cases**

- **YouTube**: Prioritize your subscriptions and hide the comment section if you never engage with it.

- **E-Commerce**: Hide promotional popups or emphasize buttons you click on often.

## üìÇ **File Overview**

The extension is built with several core files:

- **`settings.json`**: Stores your personalized configurations, including the selectors for elements and their respective actions.
  
  Example:
  ```json
  {
    "example.com": {
      "selectors": {
        "sidebar": "#sidebar",
        "comments": ".comments",
        "search": "#search",
        "like": "#like"
      },
      "actions": {
        "sidebar": {
          "action": "scale",
          "threshold": 5
        },
        "comments": {
          "action": "hide",
          "threshold": 0
        },
        "search": {
          "action": "scale",
          "threshold": 3
        },
        "like": {
          "action": "opacity",
          "threshold": 2
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- **`content.js`**: Contains the logic for interacting with elements and applying user-selected actions.

- **`example.html`**: A basic page for testing and experimenting with the extension‚Äôs features.

- **`manifest.json`**: Describes the extension‚Äôs metadata and permissions.

---

## üß© **Advanced Customization**

- **Dynamic Element Detection**: The extension intelligently tracks which elements you interact with most on each page and applies actions based on usage.
- **Thresholds for Actions**: Customize the visibility threshold for each action (e.g., how long an element must remain visible to trigger an action).
- **Export & Import**: You can **export your customizations** and transfer them to another browser or share with others.

---

## üí° **User Experience Example**

Imagine you‚Äôre watching YouTube:
- The extension learns that you **only watch subscription-based videos**, so it automatically places the **subscriptions section at the top**.
- It notices that you **never read the comments**, so it hides them entirely.
- You interact with the **search bar a lot**, so it keeps it visible at all times, even if you scroll down the page.

It‚Äôs that simple!
